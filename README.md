# expense-tracker
The provided code is an Expense Tracker application developed using Python and the Tkinter library for building graphical user interfaces. It allows users to track their expenses by entering details such as the date, payee, description, amount, and mode of payment. The application utilizes an SQLite database to store and retrieve expense data.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionality of the Expense Tracker:

Database Setup:

The code establishes a connection to an SQLite database file named "Expense Tracker.db" using the sqlite3 module.
It creates a table named "ExpenseTracker" (if it doesn't already exist) with columns for ID, Date, Payee, Description, Amount, and ModeOfPayment.
GUI Setup:

The code utilizes the Tkinter library to create the graphical user interface.
It creates various frames for data entry, buttons, and a tree view to display expense records.
Labels, entry fields, and buttons are placed within these frames to facilitate interaction.
Functionality:

The list_all_expenses() function retrieves all expense records from the database and populates the tree view with the data.
The view_expense_details() function displays the details of a selected expense when the user clicks the corresponding row in the tree view.
The clear_fields() function resets the entry fields and deselects the selected expense in the tree view.
The remove_expense() function deletes the selected expense record from the database and updates the tree view accordingly.
The remove_all_expenses() function deletes all expense records from the database and updates the tree view.
The add_another_expense() function adds a new expense record to the database based on the values entered in the entry fields.
The edit_expense() function allows the user to edit the details of a selected expense and updates the database accordingly.
The selected_expense_to_words() function displays a message showing how to read the selected expense record.
The expense_to_words_before_adding() function displays a message showing how the entered expense record would be read and provides an option to add it to the database.
GUI Layout:

The GUI is divided into frames, each containing specific elements such as labels, entry fields, and buttons.
The pack() and place() methods are used to position and layout the GUI components within their respective frames.
Treeview:

The ttk.Treeview widget is used to display the expense records in a tabular format.
The heading() method is used to set column headings, and the column() method is used to define column widths.
Scrollbars are added to the tree view for horizontal and vertical scrolling.
Please note that the provided code snippet is just a part of the entire application, and any missing code should be added accordingly for the complete functionality.
